Helper tools to implement Continuous Deployment atop AWS Services (especially with Jenkins)

## Acknowledgements
This tool got its start from https://github.com/bazaarvoice/s3-upload-maven-plugin to which it is
heavily indebted, especially the S3 uploader.  While I have decided to go ahead and fork from there 
to allow more active development (last commit was 12/31/2013) and add more HTTP-centric things to the
tool, this is in no way intended as disrespect to what is still an awesome tool.
