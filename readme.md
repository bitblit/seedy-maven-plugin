seedy-maven-plugin
======================
Helper tools to implement Continuous Deployment atop AWS Services (especially with Jenkins)

Acknowledgements
----------------
This tool got its start from https://github.com/bazaarvoice/s3-upload-maven-plugin to which it is
heavily indebted, especially the S3 uploader.  While I have decided to go ahead and fork from there 
to allow more active development (last commit was 12/31/2013) and add more HTTP-centric things to the
tool, this is in no way intended as disrespect to what is still an awesome tool.

FAQ
---

* Why do I have to set environmental variables for my Key/Secret instead of using config parameters?

Because you probably check your POM file into source control, and checking your keys into source control
is a really bad idea (TM), so I'd like to save you from doing that.  Of course, you could still put them
in using some Maven tricks, but there is only so far I can go to stop you from shooting yourself in the
foot, metaphorically (or physically, for that matter).

* How do I exclude a file from upload in the s3-upload plugin?

Right now you can't - the configs set what metadata to set on the uploaded files, not whether or not to upload them
