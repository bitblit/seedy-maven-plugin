				Added the 'assumedRoleArn' and 'assumedRoleExternalId' properties to all mojos to allow
				Seedy to deploy to a different AWS account than the one on the current machine.  Typical use
				case is when the build server is on account but is deploying to another account.  See
				http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-usingrole-switchapi.html for some
				details.
